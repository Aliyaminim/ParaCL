//first example
a = 1;
print a; //prints 1

{
    //nested scope
    a = 2;
    print a; //prints 2
}

print a; //prints 2, but we expect 1, don't we??

//second example

if (a > 0) {
    a = 9;
}

print a;
//prints 9 and we expect 9, so scopes in different contexts should be considered differently..
// Am I wrong? The problem is how we should treat variables with the same name in nested scopes
